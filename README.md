## Overview
This project evaluates healthcare quality across hospitals in the United States by analyzing the HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) Patient Survey dataset. The goal is to derive actionable insights and present findings through an interactive and engaging Power BI report.

## Challenge Objective
For the Maven Healthcare Challenge, the role of a Data Analyst for the American Hospital Association (AHA) involved analyzing HCAHPS survey results from 2013 to 2022. The initiative aims to provide a standardized survey instrument for measuring patientsâ€™ perspectives on hospital care, with the primary goal of creating incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care.
- The analysis focuses on answering the following key questions:
- Have hospitals' HCAHPS scores improved over the past 9 years?
- Are there any specific areas where hospitals have made more progress than others?
- Are there major areas of opportunity remaining?
- What recommendations can help hospitals further improve the patient experience?

## About the Dataset
The dataset includes:
- National and state-level results from 2013 to 2022.
- Hospital-level completions and response rates.

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI: Used for creating visualizations and building an interactive dashboard.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used to create measures and calculated columns for advanced data analysis.

## Process
#### Data Understanding:
- Studied the Data Dictionary to understand relationships among tables, emphasizing Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, and data types.
- Used a Description table to identify column details.

#### Result Analysis:
Evaluated trends across 9 years.
- Top-Box: 69.40% - 72.30%.
- Middle-Box: 19.60% - 21%.
- Bottom-Box: 8% - 9.60%.
  
From 2021 to 2022, composite measure types showed a decline in almost all measures.

#### Key Insights:
Areas with increased dissatisfaction:
- Cleanliness of Hospital Environment.
- Communication about Medicines.
- Responsiveness of Hospital Staff.
- Discharge Information.
  
Decline in the number of hospitals surveyed over the years, directly impacting response rates.
- South Atlantic Region:
- Highest number of completed surveys.
- Lowest response rate.

Sharp decline in response rates from 30.84% (2014) to 22.36% (2022).

#### Visualization:
Divided insights into demographics, national-level results, and state-level results.
- Created an interactive dashboard with bookmarks for:

Overview.
- Detailed drill-through analysis.
- Insights and recommendations.
  
## Recommendations
Implement corrective measures in key dissatisfaction areas:
- Improve hospital cleanliness.
- Enhance staff responsiveness and communication about medicines.
- Provide clear and detailed discharge information.

Increase hospital participation in the survey to improve response rates.

Focus on regions with lower response rates to address survey participation challenges.

## Conclusion
This project provides actionable insights into the performance of U.S. hospitals over the past nine years using HCAHPS survey data. The interactive Power BI dashboard highlights trends, opportunities, and recommendations to help hospitals improve the patient experience and achieve better survey outcomes
